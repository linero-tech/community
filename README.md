# Linero Tech Community
In this repository, you will find the discussions for the various educational programs. Feel free to ask questions, discuss topics with other students, or suggest how we can improve the education.

## Keep In mind
- Prior to creating a new discussion, please take a look at previous discussions to see if someone else has already asked your question. If you find a similar discussion, reply with additional details or upvote the discussion to signal your support rather than creating a new one.

- When creating a new post, make sure to choose the predetermined category that best fits the education you are studying. This will help you and other students quickly find answers to questions.

- Please review the [CODE OF CONDUCT](https://github.com/linero-tech/community/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) before participating in discussions.
