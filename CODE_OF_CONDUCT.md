The Linero Tech Community, powered by GitHub Discussions, is intended to be a place for collaboration, support, and brainstorming. This is a civilized place for connecting with other students, learning new skills, sharing feedback and ideas, and finding all the support you need during your educational journey with us. By participating in the Linero Tech Community, you are agreeing to the terms specified in this document.

With this Code of Conduct, we hope to help you understand how best to collaborate in the Linero Tech Community, what you can expect from moderators, and what type of actions or content may result in temporary or permanent suspension from community participation. We will investigate any abuse reports and may moderate public content within the Linero Tech Community that we determine to be in violation the code of conduct.

Our diverse student base brings different perspectives, ideas, and experiences, and ranges from people who created have never written a single line of code to more seasoned developers. We are committed to making Linero Tech an environment that welcomes all the different voices and perspectives our community has to offer, while maintaining a safe place for students to do their best work.

## Pledge
In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as contributors and maintainers pledge to making participation in the Linero Tech Community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Standards
Treat the Linero Tech Community with respect. We are a shared resource — a place to share skills, knowledge, and interests through ongoing conversation.

The following are not hard and fast rules, merely aids to the human judgment of our community. Use these guidelines to keep this a clean, well-lighted place for civilized public discourse.

### Best Practices for Maintaining a Strong Community
The primary purpose of the the Linero Tech community is to receive help and assistance during your educatinonal journey. We are committed to maintaining a community where users are free to express themselves and challenge one another's ideas, both technical and otherwise. At the same time, it's important that users remain respectful and allow space for others to contribute openly. In order to foster both a safe and productive environment, we encourage our community members to look to these guidelines to inform how they interact on our platform. Below, you’ll find some suggestions for how to have successful interactions as a valued member of the the Linero Tech community.

#### Engage with consideration and respect.
- **Be welcoming and open-minded**.  New users join our community regularly. Some are well-established developers, while others are just beginning. Be open to other ideas and experience levels. Make room for opinions other than your own and be welcoming to new collaborators and those just getting started.

- **Be respectful**. Working in a collaborative environment means disagreements may happen. But remember to criticize ideas, not people. Share thoughtful, constructive criticism and be courteous to those you interact with. If you’re unable to engage respectfully, consider taking a step back or using some of our moderation tools to deescalate a tense situation.

- **Be empathetic.** Linero Tech attracts students from a wide variety of backgrounds and perspectives, many of which may not be your own. Try to put yourself in others’ shoes and understand their feelings before you address them. Do your best to help make the Linero Tech community a place where others feel safe to make contributions, participate in discussions, and share different ideas.

#### Contribute in a positive and constructive way.
- **Improve the discussion.** Help us make this a great place for discussion by always working to improve the discussion in some way, however small. If you are not sure your post adds to the conversation, think over what you want to say and try again later. The topics discussed here matter to us, and we want you to act as if they matter to you, too. Be respectful of the topics and the people discussing them, even if you disagree with some of what is being said.

- **Be clear and stay on topic.** The Linero Tech Community is for collaboration, sharing ideas, and helping each other get stuff done. Off-topic comments are a distraction from getting work done and being productive. Staying on topic helps produce positive and productive discussions. This applies to sharing links, as well. Any links shared in the discussions should be shared with the intent of providing relevant and appropriate information. Links should not be posted to simply drive traffic or attention to a site. Links should always be accompanied by a full explanation of the content and purpose of the link. Posting links, especially unsolicited ones, without relevant and valuable context can come across as advertising or serving even more malicious purposes.

- **Share mindfully.** When asking others to give you feedback or collaborate on a task or project, only share valuable and relevant resources to provide context. Don't post links that don't add value to the discussion, and don't post unsolicited links to your own projects or sites on other user's threads.

- **Don't share sensitive information.** This includes your own email address, phone number, and any piece of personal information.

- **Keep it tidy.** Make the effort to put things in the right place, so that we can spend more time discussing and less time cleaning up. So:

  - Don’t start a discussion in the wrong category.
  - Don’t cross-post the same thing in multiple discussions.
  - Don’t post no-content replies.
  - Don't "bump" posts, unless you have new and relevant information to share.
  - Don’t divert a discussion by changing it midstream.
  - Rather than posting “+1” or “Agreed”, use the upvote button. Rather than taking an existing discussion in a radically different direction, open a new discussion.

#### Be trustworthy.
- Always be honest. Don’t knowingly share incorrect information or intentionally mislead other students. If you don’t know the answer to someone’s question but still want to help, you can try helping them research or find resources instead. Linero Tech staff will also be active in the Linero Tech Community, so if you’re unsure of an answer, it’s likely a moderator will be able to help.

### Reasonable use of AI generated content
We love experimenting with new technologies. But as with all new technology, many of us are still getting accustomed to using generative AI tools the most effectively. Here are important guidelines to follow when using generative AI to answer questions in the community:

- Take personal responsibility for everything you post.
- Read and revise the content before you post it; use your own authentic voice.
- Use your expertise to verify that the answer works and makes sense.
- Do not just post AI-generated content verbatim to inflate your reputation or give a false impression of expertise.

Additionally, all of the guidelines listed in the previous section (Best Practices for Maintaining a Strong Community) also apply here.

## Enforcement
### What Linero Tech Community Participants Can Do
- **If you see a problem, report it.** Moderators have special authority; they are responsible for this Community. But so are you. With your help, moderators can be community facilitators, not just janitors or police.

- **When you see bad behavior, don’t reply.** It encourages the bad behavior by acknowledging it, consumes your energy, and wastes everyone’s time. You can report a disruptive user or disruptive content to Linero Tech.

### Our Responsibilities
There are a variety of actions that we may take in response to inappropriate behavior or content. It usually depends on the exact circumstances of a particular case. We recognize that sometimes people may say or do inappropriate things for any number of reasons. Perhaps they did not realize how their words would be perceived. Or maybe they just let their emotions get the best of them. Of course, sometimes, there are folks who just want to spam or cause trouble.

Each case requires a different approach, and we try to tailor our response to meet the needs of the situation. We'll review each situation on a case-by-case basis. In each case, we will have a diverse team investigate the content and surrounding facts and respond as appropriate, using this Code of Conduct to guide our decision.

Actions we may take in response to a flag or abuse report include, but are not limited to:
- Content Removal
- Content Blocking
- Ban from the community

## Contacting the Linero Tech Staff
If, for any reason, you want to contact Linero Tech Staff, the Community Managers, Administrators, or Moderators of the Linero Tech Community privately, you can send an email to `support@linerotech.se`. Contacting any member of the Linero Tech Staff via unsolicited mentions or pings, or via channels other than Community itself, or the support email is strongly discouraged.

Let's work together to keep the Linero Tech Community a place where people feel safe to participate by being respectful of them and their time.
